	and/or MRI compatible applicators allow a sectional image based approach
	with a better assessment of gross tumour volume (GTV) and definition
	and delineation of target volume (CTV) compared to traditional approaches.
	Accurate and reproducible delineation of GTV, CTV and PTV, as well
	as of critical organs has a direct impact on BT treatment planning,
	especially if it is possible to adapt the pear-shape isodose by optimisation
	using DVH analysis. When introducing a 3D image based approach for
	GTV and CTV assessment, there is a need for a common language to
	describe the concepts and to define the terms which are to be used.
	In 2000, GEC-ESTRO decided to support 3D imaging based 3D treatment
	planning approach in cervix cancer BT with the creation of a Working
	Group. The task was to describe basic concepts and terms and to work
	out a terminology enabling various groups working in this advanced
	field to use a common language. The recommendations described in
	this report were proposed based on clinical experience and dosimetric
	concepts of different institutions (IGR, Leuven, Vienna) and were
	stepwise validated against the background of different clinical experience.
	As GTV and CTV for BT change significantly during treatment, time
	frame for assessment of GTV and CTV for BT is specified in this report:
	at time of diagnosis GTVD, CTVD and at time of BT GTVB, CTVB. Furthermore,
	CTV for BT is defined related to risk for recurrence: high risk CTV
	and intermediate risk CTV. Beside verbal descriptions detailed examples
	are given, partly in form of schematic drawings.},

	The ability to visualize treatment portals continuously during a

	In this report, we show and discuss a sequence of instant portal
	images obtained during a single treatment in which motion and absence

	carcinoma. Methods and parameters have been developed and validated
	from dosimetric, imaging and clinical experience from different institutions
	(University of Vienna, IGR Paris, University of Leuven). Cumulative
	dose volume histograms (DVH) are recommended for evaluation of the
	complex dose heterogeneity. DVH parameters for GTV, HR CTV and IR
	CTV are the minimum dose delivered to 90 and 100% of the respective
	volume: D90, D100. The volume, which is enclosed by 150 or 200% of
	the prescribed dose (V150, V200), is recommended for overall assessment
	of high dose volumes. V100 is recommended for quality assessment
	only within a given treatment schedule. For Organs at Risk (OAR)
	the minimum dose in the most irradiated tissue volume is recommended
	for reporting: 0.1, 1, and 2cm3; optional 5 and 10cm3. Underlying
	assumptions are: full dose of external beam therapy in the volume
	of interest, identical location during fractionated brachytherapy,
	contiguous volumes and contouring of organ walls for >2cm3. Dose
	values are reported as absorbed dose and also taking into account
	different dose rates. The linear-quadratic radiobiological model—equivalent
	dose (EQD2)—is applied for brachytherapy and is also used for calculating
	dose from external beam therapy. This formalism allows systematic
	assessment within one patient, one centre and comparison between
	different centres with analysis of dose volume relations for GTV,
	CTV, and OAR. Recommendations for the transition period from traditional
	to 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy are formulated. Supplementary

	at reference points and dimensions and volumes for the GTV and CTV
	(adding to [Haie-Meder C, Pötter R, Van Limbergen E et al. Recommendations
	from Gynaecological (GYN) GEC ESTRO Working Group (I): concepts and
	terms in 3D image-based 3D treatment planning in cervix cancer brachytherapy
	with emphasis on MRI assessment of GTV and CTV. Radiother Oncol 2005;74:235–245]).
	It is expected that the therapeutic ratio including target coverage
	and sparing of organs at risk can be significantly improved, if radiation
	dose is prescribed to a 3D image-based CTV taking into account dose
	volume constraints for OAR. However, prospective use of these recommendations
	in the clinical context is warranted, to further explore and develop
	the potential of 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy.},
