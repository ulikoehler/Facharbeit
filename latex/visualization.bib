	data structures, most current approaches for volume visualization
	do not meet the requirements of daily clinical routine. In this diploma
	thesis, an approach for interactive high-quality rendering of large

	with object-order data traversal, using an optimized cache coherent
	memory layout. New techniques and parallelization strategies for
	direct volume rendering of large data on commodity hardware are presented.
	By using new memory efficient acceleration data structures, high-quality
	direct volume rendering of several hundred megabyte sized datasets
	at sub-second frame rates on a commodity notebook is achieved.},

	applied to CT data for 3-D visualization of skeletal pathology. This
	review illustrates potential limitations of each technique by directly
	comparing 3-D images of bone pathology created using volume rendering
	and surface rendering. Surface renderings show gross 3-D relationships
	most effectively, but suffer from more stairstep artifacts and fail
	to effectively display lesions hidden behind overlying bone or located
	beneath the bone cortex. Volume-rendering algorithms effectively
	show subcortical lesions, minimally displaced fractures, and hidden
	areas of interest with few artifacts. Volume algorithms show 3-D
	relationships with varying degrees of success depending on the degree
	of surface shading and opacity. While surface rendering creates more
	three-dimensionally realistic images of the bone surface, it may
	be of limited clinical utility due to numerous artifacts and the
	inability to show subcortical pathology. Volume rendering is a flexible
	3-D technique that effectively displays a variety of skeletal pathology
	with few artifacts.},
