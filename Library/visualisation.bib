  author = {Ronald T. Azuma},
  title = {A Survey of Augmented Reality},
  year = {1997},
  abstract = {This paper surveys the field of Augmented Reality, in which 3-D virtual
	objects are integrated into a 3-D real environment in real time.
	It describes the medical, manufacturing, visualization, path planning,
	entertainment and military applications that have been explored.
	This paper describes the characteristics of Augmented Reality systems,
	including a detailed discussion of the tradeoffs between optical
	and video blending approaches. Registration and sensing errors are
	two of the biggest problems in building effective Augmented Reality
	systems, so this paper summarizes current efforts to overcome these
	problems. Future directions and areas requiring further research
	are discussed. This survey provides a starting point for anyone interested
	in researching or using Augmented Reality. 1. Introduction 1.1 Goals
	This paper surveys the current state-of-the-art in Augmented Reality.
	It describes work performed at many different sites and explains
	the issues and problems encountered when ...},

	image data; overlaying with either volume or surface rendered (segmented)
	data using different methodologies; and tracking of moving objects
